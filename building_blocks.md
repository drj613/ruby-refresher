**Numbers, Operators, Expressions**:
- What’s the difference between an `Integer` and a `Float`?
  - Integers are whole numbers, floats have decimals.
- Why should you be careful when converting back and forth between integers and floats?
  - You lose decimals and, transitively, accuracy.
- What’s the difference between =, ==, and ===?
  - `=` sets a value, `==` compares values, `===` compares values and data types
- How do you do exponents in Ruby?
  - `**`; `a**b` is equal to `a^b`.
- What is a `range`?
  - An interval with a beginning and an end. Usually numbers or letters.
- How do you create a range?
  - `x..y` or `x...y`
- What’s the difference between `(1..3)` and `(1...3)`?
  - `..` is inclusive, `...` excludes the uppermost value.
- What are three ways to create a range?
  - `x..y`, `x...y`, `Range.new(x, y)`

**Strings**
- What’s the difference between single and double quotes?
  - Double quotes allow for string interpolation.
- What is string interpolation?
  - Interpolation inserts the values of an object as a string. Signified like so: `"{my_object}"`
- What are escape characters?
  - Characters which invoke an alternative interpretation of following characters
- What are line breaks?
  - `"/n"`, the string representation of starting a new line with `Enter`
- How do you make other things into strings?
  - `to_s`
- How do you concatenate strings?
  - `str.concat("string_to_add")` OR `"str_one" + "str_two"`
- How do you access a specific character or substring?
  - Refer to the index/indeces of the character/string: `'abc'[1] => "b"`
- How do you split up strings into arrays?
  - `str.split()`
- How are strings and arrays similar?
  - They're both able to contain multiple different values, and those values are referenced the same way (`object[index]`)
- How do you get and clean up user input on the command line?
  - `gets` takes input and includes a trailing line break; `gets.chomp` will remove the trailing line break
- What does it mean that strings are “mutable” and why care?  
  - Mutable values can be changed after they are set. Constant values should not be mutable.
- What is a symbol?
  - Symbols are a reference to a value.
- How is a symbol different from a string?
  - Symbols are immutable, and take up less memory
- What is a Regular Expression (RegEx)?
  - A sequence of characters used to define a search pattern
- How can you center or right-justify a string?
  - `s.center(x)`, `s.ljust(x)`, `s.rjust(x)`, where `x` is the number of characters of padding that you want.

  **Arrays**:

- What are three ways to create an array?
  - `Array.new(values, to, add)`, `my_array = [1, 2, 3]`, `digits = Array(0..9)`
- How do you prepopulate the array with default data?
  - Declare values as parameters withing Array.new or within brackets depending on method used to create the array.
- How do you access items in an array?
  - `array_name[index]`
- How can you access a specific group of items in an array?
  -
- How do you modify the items in an array?
- How do you combine arrays?
- How do you find the values in one array that aren’t in another?
- How do you find values in both arrays?
- What is the difference between push/pop and shift/unshift?
- What is the shovel operator?
- How is > arr.pop different from > arr[-1]?
- How is pushing or <<ing another array into your array different from just adding them together?
- How do you delete items in an array?
- Why should you be careful deleting items in an array?
- How can you convert arrays to strings?
- How can you convert from other data types to arrays?
- How can you figure out if an array contains a particular value?
- How do you find the biggest item in an array?
- How do you find the smallest item in an array?
- How do you remove any duplicates from your array?
- How do you find out how big an array is?
- How do you put an array in order?
- What are the naming conventions for arrays?
- What should you store in arrays?
